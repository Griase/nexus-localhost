# Vesper
replica of websim.com (as of 2/13/2026 it's still up US date format)
expected to have really long time between releases after march since most of this IS made on websim, since i'm a larp vibecoder skid.

also, i updated the name / rebranded to vesper on 2/20/2026 us format or so. whenever i upload the files i'll update it.
ALSO VESPER1 COMES PRE-PACKAGED!!!!! don't expect a lot though, it 's just qwen2.5 3b or 5b
