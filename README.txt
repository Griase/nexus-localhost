how to install:

if you want to, edit your port (automatically set to 8000 just because)
run pip install -r requirements.txt for libraries used. (run python -m playwright install chromium too just incase you
didn't get it before)
rest should work by itself
ALSO EDIT DIRECTORIES I DONT KNOW IF IT WILL WORK ON SITE
